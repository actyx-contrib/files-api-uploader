# files-api-uploader
With Actyx v2.8.0, we've released the `Files API` that provides for uploading to, retrieving from and naming files in Actyx. Shout-out to @wngr who made that happen :pray:. 

For details, please refer to the reference in the [develveloper documentation](https://developer.actyx.com/docs/reference/files-api)

This repository contains a simple app to upload (multiple) files to Actyx to get you started. Hope that helps.

## üìÑ Files API

### ‚ú® Capabilities
* Files can be uploaded as `multipart/formdata`. 
* To make uploading more convenient than using `curl`, this repository contains a sample uploader HTML page to allow for uploading files and folder hierarchies more easily.
* Uploading a file returns a content identifier (`CID`), which is a unique hash based on the file's content.
* Files can be accessed either via
  `http://localhost:4454/api/v2/files/<cid>/<optional path>` or via
  `http://<cid>.actyx.localhost::4454/<optional path>`. This enables serving
  webapps from the content root conveniently.
* The Actyx Naming Service (`ANS`) allows you to attach a name to a `CID` and access the content using that name through `http://<name>.actyx.localhost:4454/<optional path>`. You can also update that name to point to a different `CID`, allowing you to roll out new versions of a file/app.
* The authentication token for Actyx API access can be provided through the `?token=...` query parameter.

### üö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Walk-Through
1. Get an authentication token using an Actyx manifest and store it in the `AUTH_TOKEN` variable. Uses `curl` to make the request and `jq` to parse the result.
```bash
$ export AUTH_TOKEN=$(echo '
{
    "appId": "com.example.actyx-v1-pond",
    "displayName": "V1 Pond API compatible with V2 store",
    "version": "1.0"
}
' \
| curl \
    -s -X "POST" \
    -d @- \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    http://localhost:4454/api/v2/auth \
| jq -r .token)
```

2. Upload the attached file uploader HTML.
```bash
$ curl -X POST \
   -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
   -F file=@upload_files.html \
   http://localhost:4454/api/v2/files

bafybeiaqela5uulk5qycsxncdtv36stuowojyuso3dnwlaninksco5cfpi # Returns the CID of the uploaded file
```
3. Assign a name to the `CID` returned in the previous step, with `uploader` being the name to assign. You'll see `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` somewhere in the output if the upload went through as expected.
```bash
$ echo bafybeiaqela5uulk5qycsxncdtv36stuowojyuso3dnwlaninksco5cfpi | \
  curl -s -X PUT \
  -d @- \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"  \
  http://localhost:4454/api/v2/files/uploader -v
```
4. Open the uploader using the name you assigned earlier, http://uploader.actyx.localhost:4454/.

5. Upload files or SPA folders as you see fit, noting their `CID`s in case you want to name them as well. Use drag'n'drop to add files, enter your auth token (see step 1) in the corresponding field and click `upload`.

6. You can now go ahead, add new content again and/or assign names to existing `CID`s as described before (or make a PR implementing naming against this repo üòè), e.g.
```bash
echo bafybeieod6ngzponojuau3vwxshptnwqcdoa436obbgv3z2jluxzlc4wqy | \
  curl -s -X PUT \
  -d @- \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"  \
  http://localhost:4454/api/v2/files/hello
```

7. After that, you can access the file through the attached name on any Actyx node in the swarm _locally_
